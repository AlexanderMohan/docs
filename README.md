# AlexanderMohan Docs
## Purpose of this repo
This repo provides for docs.alexandermohan.com, which is the central location for all docs on AlexanderMohan projects. *Some documentation for some products are private*. These are accessible through either the product or your AlexanderMohan portal account, and are thus not visible here. Most developer documentation is available similarly, for some open source projects a request for access is all that is needed with no payment required.

If you're here you're probably a developer. Please contact dev@alexandermohan.com for access and your next steps. Cheers!
