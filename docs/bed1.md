## Bedlam Theatre and the EUTC

Bedlam Theatre is a unique, entirely student-run theatre in the centre of Edinburgh. Clearly visible from Edinburgh’s Royal Mile in the heart of the city, Bedlam is a fully operational 90-seat theatre housed in an imposing neo-gothic church. Bedlam Exterior

Bedlam Theatre is both a listed building and a historical landmark - a unique space and community where students maintain the building themselves throughout the year.

The Edinburgh University Theatre Company puts on over 40 shows a year, and workshops and productions alike provide students with a unique opportunity to learn about all aspects of theatre, including lighting design, soundscaping, stage design, producing, directing and acting. Many Bedlamites go on to train at some of the best drama schools in the UK, while others move directly into the professional world – our alumni include critically acclaimed playwrights Ella Hickson (Boys, Eight) and Lucy Kirkwood (Hedda, NSFW), actor and comedian Miles Jupp (The Thick of It, Rev), and Fringe comedy favourites, ‘The Penny Dreadfuls’.
